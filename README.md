Python scripting

I have started to learn how to script in Python. After being amidst all the buzz surrounding Python I decided to give it a shot and boy was I impressed.

Having spent most of my coding life on C, I was overwhelmed with the cleaner syntax and higher functionality quotient of Python. Additionally the book I was reading had a great approach to Python as well.

So right now I have started doing basic programming on Python, however down the line I expect to develop complex code, given the fact that Python supports a good crossover framework with MySQL and sockets.

The idea is to add handy Python code over time, that helps us perform specific annoying and not-so-annoying jobs
