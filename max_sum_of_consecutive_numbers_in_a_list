# So I have a list / array which has several numbers in it.The goal of this code is to find out the maximum sum of consecutive numbers.

iData = [7,12,93,48,56,62,71,18,9,110]

iLength = len (iData)

# print iLength
iCount = 1
iSum = 0
iAdd = []

while iCount < iLength:

	iSum = iData[iCount-1] + iData[iCount]
	iAdd.append (iSum)
	iCount+=1

# prints the consecutive sums in the list
print iAdd

# prints the maximum sum of consecutive numbers from the list
print max(iAdd)
